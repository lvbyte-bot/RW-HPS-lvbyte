`http://gs1.corrodinggames.com/masterserver/1.4/interface`  
`http://gs4.corrodinggames.net/masterserver/1.4/interface`  

The returned data should contain an ID (decoded from the JSON ID returned by the API).

### Port Opening

After replacement, you can send a POST request to:  
`http://gs1.corrodinggames.com/masterserver/1.4/interface`

The returned data should contain `IP,true`. If it returns `IP,false`, the port is not open.
